I'm Dan... the main nerd who sells.

I love to code and build unique... great looking websites and apps.

(If you have an app idea and need a developer...<PostLink slug="/contact">let's talk</PostLink>!)

**My special skill set taking ideas and building them online**... for fun and profit.

I've owned three businesses of my own in the past:

1. Freelance web design and copywriting (now I'm back)
2. An importing and ecommerce store
3. And a private fitness studio we still own today

I know what it takes to work with clients... be **honest**... **clean**... and **overdeliver for results**.
