What''s your website for?

I think about this a lot because it's not as easy to answer as you'd think.

I can come up with a couple reasons.

### 1. To Get Found

Your busienss... products... and services can never be found... unless there is something to find.

**The first job is to be found**.

- This could be through sharing your website with people.
- Advertising your website through ads... (landing pages).
- Creating content that's found on Google and other search engines.

But you need your site to be found first... otherwise it won't ever do anything.

### 2. Segment Your Audience

Your website probably has a lot of information about what you do and sell.

And any given visitor probably only cares about a small subsection of that information...

The stuff that's relavant to them.

Your website **needs to make it easy for visitors to find what they want**... and easier to take the right action like:

- Contacting you
- Signing up for your email list
- Buying your product
- Making a phone call or text

This is very hard to do.

Building navigation is tough. I struggle with this all the time.

This is why it is important to setup goals in Google Analytics or other platforms so you can determine if what you are trying to make happen... is really happening.

If you need help setting up Google Analytics on your website... with goals... <InternalLink slug="/contact">contact me</InternalLink> and let's talk.

### 3. Sell Sell Sell

If you have an ecommerce store your website's purpose is easy.

Sell lots of products.

### What's a Landing Page For?

Essentially every page on your website is a landing page.

It should have one message... one purpose... with one call to action.

But this is not always the case as some pages:

- Are category or list pages.
- Informational pages
- Blog posts

**A landing page always has**:

- One big idea
- One avatar to talk to
- One purpose and offer
- No navigation for the user to complete the offer (most of the time)

Landing pages don't require visitors to find what they need... **landing pages deliever immediately**.

#### One Big Idea And One Product

On a landing page you're selling one service... one product... one offer to get a lead.

Nothing else is brought up or mentioned.

**Start by picking your most popular service or product** and create a landing page around that.

You have your service or product... now it's time to start building the big idea.

But first you need to know...

#### The Avatar

An avatar is **the ideal person who would purchse your product or service**.

For example...

Our avatar for our fitness business is:

- Female in her mid to upper 30s
- She has two children
- She has a job probably remote
- She prefers to workout at home and save time
- In the past she's tried Beach Body subscriptions and services like that with no results.

This is a sample, but you should flesh out a real person.

When you have your avatar and your product of service...

You can create **the big idea that connects the two**.

For example...

<CallOutBox>

"Our 30 minute express workouts make it easy for busy moms to workout and get back to their day quickly."

</CallOutBox>

It would be cool if we could find some research to discover how remote work has changed family life... etc... and connect it to a free trial offer for two weeks.

I just came up with that one the spot.

But now that I did... maybe there is a connection between increased stress for at home work. So we can connect the stress releif of working out for remote moms.

Once you start your brain will begin coming up with all sorts of ideas.

**But you can only choose one**.

#### The Purpose or Offer

One offer.

No options.

- Buy my product for this amount.
- Enter your email address and get this coupon for a free 30 minute session.
- Sign up for a free 14 day trial.

And here's the part even I aways screw up when I write copy for my own business.

**You're selling the offer... not the product**.

For example...

You're selling the coupon.

What are the benefits for the customer for getting the coupon... not necessarily the service.

Focus on the benefits of the coupon!

For example...

A coupon for a free 30 minute massage.

<CallOutBox>

"You deserve 30 minutes to escape your life.

30 minutes where you can close your eyes... take a deep breath knowing your phone won't buzz... your kids won't yell... and email can't bother you.

We'll push out your stress so you can attack the rest of your day feeling rejuvinated.

Are you ready for your FREE 30 mintue mini-vacation?"

</CallOutBox>

See where I'm going with this...

It's not the massage itself. It's what the 30 minute session is going to do for you.

Save you from your hecitc day... give you a mini-vacation...

#### No Navigation

This is tough because you need some navigation.

I'm not 100% certain but I think Google penalizes landing pages that have zero links on them.

I don't think you can even advertise them on the Adwords platform if you don't have links to the rest of your site.

But **that doesn't mean the links have to go at the very top**.

Stick them in the footer.

**Make a custom footer** that highlights the offer again and then shows the links to the rest of the website.

It's a fact of the internet... the more links you have on a page... the more visitors will fall off.

### Use Landing Pages

Here's how I see most online strategies... even social strategies.

**Your website should be a content machine**, pumping out quality aritcles and help for the people you're serving.

You want to get your website ranked and get as much organic traffic as possible to it.

**Everything on your website direct visitors to landing pages** for specific offers.

These landing pages either collect leads you can contact... or make sales.

You then take the landing pages and advertise them using paid media to explode your lead count.

You tweak this process over time so the conversion rate is good.

And your business grows... if not sometimes explodes!

That's the difference between a website and a landing page.

If you want help **creating your first landing page for your business**... you can contact some nerds. We're the best <InternalLink slug="/">Charleston web design provider</InternalLink> for **insanely fast websites that focus on selling!**

I do plan on running real landing page tests and paid media campaigns to talk how all these factors connect to create an offer that works.

It always seems complicated. But in the real world... it's about **being clear than more than being clever**.
