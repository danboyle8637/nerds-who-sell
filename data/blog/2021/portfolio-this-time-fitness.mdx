### What Is The Goal?

A marketing website for our fitness studio.

Initially the website was built for paid advertising campaigns on Facebook and Google. It succeeded until Covid.

It's been **redesigned for a content marketing strategy first**. The goal is to get it ranked number one in Google for the relevant market keywords.

### Challenges

We redesigned the website to improve speed and better match our fitness brand.

The biggest challenge was (and still is) **finding the one big idea that creates action**.

##### What Is The Big Idea?

The big idea is the central message that connects to your prospect.

When you nail an idea... your page converts because you hit a pressing pain point on the head.

Not only identified a pain point... but communicated it in a way that makes instant sense to the prospect.

Building a blogging system that is **easy and fast to get content on the site** is another key point... but we've handled this before.

It has to be fast on mobile. Over **80% of visitors are on mobile**.

### Solutions

I built This Time Fitness on a framework called **Gatsby**. It's incredibly fast.

The site is relatively image heavy and Gatsby has amazing image optimization so the site loads almost instantly.

Running your own website speed test is easy and a good way to get an idea of where you stand.

The site is also **designed mobile first**.

**Most women will search for a fitness solution on their phone**... it's very unlikely they will be on a laptop while searching.

For blogging, we use a company called <InternalLink url="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity.io</InternalLink> for our content management system.

Sanity makes it very easy to blog and create data for the website.

Sanity allows me to build a custom content creation solution for our writers. They see exactly what they need to so they can publish easily and quickly.
