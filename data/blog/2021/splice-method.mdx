Splice is a Javascript array method.

If you're reading this... you're learning Javascript. Get to know the MDN docs... I spend a little bit of every day in these docs reading.

### What The Splice Method Does

Removes... replaces... or adds to an array based on what you pass to it and how.

It takes the starting index as the first parameter.

How many indexes you want to delete as the second parameter.

And any data you want to add as the third parameter.

It's a pretty versatile method.

### What The Splice Method Returns

An array of the removed items.

If not items are removed... an empty array is returned.

### Important

This method changes the original array. It does not make a copy... this is really important to know.

You are mutating the original array.

### When Would You Use This?

I honestly don't use this method that much.

At least not yet.

But if you ever needed to add an element or object to an array... especially in the middle of the array... this would be the method to reach for.

When I use it in the real world... I'll report back here when and how I used it.

If you've used it in a real project... let me know and maybe you'll let me include it in this article.

### Let's Look At Some Code

Here is an embed from Repl.it.

This is in Typescript but it's the same things in this case.

Keep in mind though... in Typescript you can't just add anything to an array. It will need to be of the same type.

Read the comments and look at the different cases I came up with.
