### What's The Goal?

Build an app with functionality so enticing, women sign up in droves to try it out.

With this app you can:

- **Attend LIVE streaming workouts** and workout replays.
- Follow training plans with daily goals and to-do lists.
- Test your progress with video based assessmemt workouts.
- Use a **daily workout journal** to track fitness metric that drive results.
- Plus a lot more!

**There are two main goals with this app**...

1. **For members** to make building a fitness lifestyle fun and engaging week to week.
2. **For non-members** to get excited about our services so they want to sign up and try us out.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was and still is **scope creep**.

Our version of a minimal viable product grew as development progressed. Not ideal.

This increased the time required to get real users into the app.

Tehcnical challenges included:

- Building a **lightning fast API** layer to make the app snappy quick.
- **Managing the caching layer** so users don't have to wait for data when it's already availble.
- Making the app a progressive web app.

### Solutions

**For the tech stack, we used**:

- <InternalLink url="https://nextjs.org">Nextjs</InternalLink> for frontend user
  interface.
- <InternalLink url="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/introduction">
    Vercel serverless functions
  </InternalLink> for the API layer... written in Typescript.
- <InternalLink url="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</InternalLink> for the database.

The app uses <InternalLink url="https://react-query.tanstack.com/">React Query</InternalLink> for data fetching and client side cache management. I think this can be greatly improved.

#### Dealing With Scope Creep

We built a new system for designing and **building functionality before code is every touched**.

I'll let you know how that works out... as a big feature is currectly being developed right now.

#### API Layer

This app relies heavy on dates which is one of the bigger challenges.

So we're reworking how the app accesses certain dates to make data fetching faster.

Plus we're looking at moving some endpoints for data fetching to Cloudflare Workers to see if things can be sped up.

### Stay Tuned For Updates

Over the next few monts this app is going to change a lot and hopefully we'll unlock big improvements.

**I'll write about all of these** so if you're building an app or website... you know how to plan things out.

This is one reason why hiring the right <InternalLink slug="/">Chaleston web designer</InternalLink> makes all the difference.

We'll **help you plan correctly from the bigging** so your projects get finished on time.
