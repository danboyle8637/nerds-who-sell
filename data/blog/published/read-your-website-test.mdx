When you're learning to write copy... there's one word that pops up over and over again.

**Any guesses?**

Think about it. Most people with a website get this wrong.

And even knowing this word doesn't mean you won't make mistake after mistake... I do all the time.

But first let's test your...

### Website's Readability and Messaging

#### Step 1: Get Your Copy

Take a landing page or sales page.

- Go up to the edit menu...
- Click on "select all"".
- Open up your computers basic text editor. The one it comes with.
- Hit comand v on a Mac or control v on a Windows machine.

  imageWidth={1200}
  imageHeight={680}
  containerWidth={100}
  alt="Selecting all of the test on your webpage."
  title="Select All Text On Your Webpage"
/>

All of the text for that page will appear in your text editor.

**Clean up the menu text and the alternate text form images and buttons**.

You should be left with only the headlines and body copy of your page.

  imageWidth={1200}
  imageHeight={680}
  containerWidth={100}
  alt="Past and clean up text in simple text editor."
  title="Paste and Clean Up In Text Editor"
/>

The reason I like to get the copy in a text editor is to isolate it. So the reader can only focus on reading... nothing else.

#### Step 2: Beg a Friend or Co-worker

Beg a friend or co-worker to sit stand in front of you and read the copy out loud... **while you sit and listen**.

You might have to bribe or cajole somebody... work hard... it's worth it.

#### Step 3: Listen

Listen to your website.

Try to **answer some basic questions as you listen**:

- Who is this for?
- What is being offered?
- What should you do next if you were the visitor?

The answers to these questions should be short... a sentance max.

#### Step 4: Ponder

Based on what you heard... ponder before you start changing things around.

**Ask yourself some of these quetsions**:

- What was I trying to say?
- Who is my customer... or the customer I want?
- What are all the possible offers I can make?
- Makes the offer that matters to my customer?

This is a quick brain storm into how you can improve your messaging.

Write these answers down in a program you know you will come back to and use.

### What Did You Learn?

This is a short test I try to do whenever I write messaging or copy to sell something.

Even just a blog post because...

- What you think you wrote...
- What you actually wrote...
- And what people read...

All three will be different.

Think about a novel. The author has ideas or themes they may be trying to get across.

But ultimately the reader creates themes and ideas based on their life and experience.

This is hard. Writing copy is tough because you can always improve it. And you'll always get better ideas.

The more I go over copy I've written... the more I refine and update it. But don't forget the real goal:

Launch something.

It's better to have something out there making an offer than a rough draft you never release.

</CallOutBox>

Which brings me back to...

### The Most Important Word In Sales Writing

Did you figure it out?

It's not persuasion.

And it's not creativity.

**It's clarity**.

The more clear you can be... the better communication you''ll have with your reader.

If you're writing is clear... it's more likely the reader will know what action you want then to take.

Which means there's a chance they might take that action.

This post''s pixel art is a laptop exploding with all of the text flying out.

I'm being blown backwards. I wanted to make ripped clothes... but that was taking too long. So my shirt is open. My wife said it reminded her of Patrick Swayze. Haha!

I had to finish this image up quickly. There is a lot I want to fix... mainly the clothes and the head position. I'm finding teeth really hard to make in pixel art.

I added some effects and glow in Affinity Photo after the fact to make the image pop more.
