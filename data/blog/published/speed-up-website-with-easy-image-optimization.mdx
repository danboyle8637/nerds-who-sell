import { CallOutBox } from "../../../src/components/mdx/CallOutBox.tsx";
import { PostLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx/Link.tsx";

I still see this mistake made today.

I was looking at a new website the other day and among many of the issues... one stuck out at me because it's so easy to fix.

### LARGE Image Sizes

I'm not talking about the size of the image on the screen.

I'm talking about the **size of the image file itself**.

Remember, images are nothing but data.

Let's look at an example.

There's a cool website called <PostLink url="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</PostLink>. **You can download high res images there for free**.

I choose a random image from Unsplash and checked the file size.

Funny enough the image I choose was **7.9 megabyte**. That's enormous.

Let me put that into perspective for you.

- There are 1000 kilobytes in 1 megabyte.
- An entire app I recently built clocks in at 220 kilobytes.
- The app is about 35,000 times smaller than one image.

**Can you see how optimizing your images can help make your website insanely faster?**

Let's tak this image. It's a little more responable in intial size.

<PostImage

  imageWidth={1440}
  imageHeight={900}
  containerWidth={100}
  alt="Large image of mountains."
  title="Large Image of Mountains"
/>

**The inital size is 1.8 megabtyes**. Much smaller than the image we referenced above... but still very large.

### How To Easily Optimize Your Image Size

#### 1. Use a Image Software

You don't need Photoshop. Photoshop is very expensive. If you use a Mac... you can use <PostLink url="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/">Affinitiy Photo</PostLink>. It costs about $49 one time... and it's just as powerful as Photoshop.

Use the software to make the image smaller... a lot smaller.

**Start with the biggest version of the image you might need**. I usually never go above 1440 pixels wide.

1440 pixels is the size of the 13 inch MacBook Pro.

With new MacBooks and laptops coming out... I might have to adjust this.

<CallOutBox>

A lot of web designers usually let their designs go to the full edge of the screen.

Most of the time, this isn't a problem because most traffic these days happens on the phone. But if you know you're audience uses laptops or desktops... you have to plan around the possiblity of wide screens.

When a website stretches across a WIDE screen... it looks terrible. So **you have to contain the full width of your website and your images**.

</CallOutBox>

Ideally you want to have different images sizes for different devices... and there are reasons to make completely different images... read this post about art direction.

But to keep things simple... export the one large size of your image.

For most images on the web, JPG format is what you want. But not always... different topic.

When you export the image... don't export it at 100% quality. **Drop it down to 90% or 80%**.

This depends. If you're a photographer... you probably want to keep your images high res to show them off.

But that **doesn't mean you have to show the high res photo on your website**. Show small image first... and have the user click to then show the high res... if you even have to show it at all. (Most of the time you don't.)

If you're a dentist or a coach or personal trainer... lower res images do perfectly.

Looking back at our starting image... **all I did was shrink it to 1440 pixels and dropped the quality to 86% of the original**.

  url="https://ik.imagekit.io/csu76xuqqlwj/nerds-who-sell/blog/2021/tr:w-800/resized-mountain-image-2_O1jCiyLIIF.jpg"
  imageWidth={1440}
  imageHeight={700}
  containerWidth={100}
  alt="Smaller image of mountains."
  title="Smaller Image of Mountains"
/>

By looking at the image... **you can't tell that it's far lower quality**.

But just this alone shrunk the image size from 1.8 megabyes to only **227 kilobytes**.

If I go further and crop the image to a smaller size for a website section backbround... **now it's only 110 kilobytes**.

What a difference!

**Can you see how much faster your website will get when you shrink your images?**

### 2. Use An Image Service

These days it's a no-brainer to use an image service.

These services can get complicated but not all of them are. I use one called <PostLink url="https://imagekit.io/">ImageKit and it's awesome</PostLink>. It's **super easy to use and the free teir is enough for most websites**.

These services are software that resize your image on the fly and deliver the right image for the right device at the moment it's needed.

All you have to do is **add in some transformations in the url of the image** and you have the right image for your device.

Plus these services will convert your images to the best file format when available.

This means even faster loading.

### That's It... Two Simple Beginner Steps

Images are one of the major bottlenecks in web design and development.

We all want them because a good images can make a huge difference.

But images require a lot of data. Just **think about video**!!!

It makes you rethink having that video background... is it really needed? Probably not.
