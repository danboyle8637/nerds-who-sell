headline: Words That Sell You!

Most websites have boring headlines...

Huge blocks of text not even a bookworm would read...

And all most businesses talk about is themselves...

Your prospects don't care about you. They care about what you can do for them.

So tell them what they want to hear.

Get them into an emotional frenzy.

This is the power of clear... focused... sales copy.
